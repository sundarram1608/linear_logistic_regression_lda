# linear_logistic_regression_lda
This repository contains all the files used for analysis of two different data sets.<br>
Techniques of Encoding, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression &amp; Linear Discriminant Analysis are leveraged in this project.<br>
The coding language used here is Python Programing.

## DataSet:
- Gem Stones (cubic_zirconia.csv).
- Tour and Travel agency (Holiday_Package.csv).

## Code File: (.ipynb)
- code_file.ipynb

## Business Report: (.pdf)
This report provides a detailed explanation on approach used, record inferences, insights and provide suitable business solutions/ recommendations.<br>
- Encoding, Linear Regression model is used in predicting the price for the stone, so it can distinguish between higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones and help the company have better profit share. <br>
- Encoding, Logistic Regression & Linear Discriminant Models are used in predicting whether an employee will opt for the package or not.

## How to run the code?
- Fork & Clone the repository
- Install the above libraries (virtual environment recommended) if not available using the command `pip install` in terminal
- Open the Code file and run all the cells. (Same Folder hierarchy as in repository to be used)
